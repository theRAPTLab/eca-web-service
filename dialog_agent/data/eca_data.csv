GEMSTEP_Observing, ,"Type: GEMSTEP_Observing, context:  , response: The color of the flower matters","In BeeVR, the color of the flower represents different species of flowers, like a flower from a zuccini plant vs. one from a strawberry plant. Why do you think that flower color matters? What does it matter for?"
GEMSTEP_Observing, ,"Type: GEMSTEP_Observing, context:  , response: What happens if the hive gets full?","In nature, if the hive gets full of food, some of the bees might split off and build a new hive. For bees in human-made hives, beekeepers can just take the extra honey out to leave room for new nectar to be collected."
GEMSTEP_Observing, ,"Type: GEMSTEP_Observing, context:  , response: I think distance is important but idk",Let's investigate what the role of distance is! Can you come up with a way to test it using BeeVR?

GEMSTEP_Observing, ,"Type: GEMSTEP_Observing, context:  , response: Did we get enough nectar?","Let's look at the bar on the hive! How much nectar does it show? A beehive with lots of bees will need a good amount of honey stored to keep everyone healthy. This is a commercial hive, so maybe the bee keeper also removed some honey?"
GEMSTEP_Observing, ,"Type: GEMSTEP_Observing, context:  , response: How do plants get pollinated",Many flowers need to be visited by bees in order to be pollinated - maybe you can figure out how bees pollinate by trying BeeVR again?

GEMSTEP_Observing, ,"Type: GEMSTEP_Observing, context:  , response: it didn't work",I'm sorry it didn't go how you thought it would. What did you notice happen that made you say that? Can you think of a way to revise your plan for next time?
GEMSTEP_Observing,Many flowers were pollinated,"Type: GEMSTEP_Observing, context: Many flowers were pollinated, response: we should visit more flowers",It sounds like that worked really well. What else do you want to explore?
GEMSTEP_Observing,Few flowers were pollinated,"Type: GEMSTEP_Observing, context: Few flowers were pollinated, response: we should visit more flowers",That sounds like a good strategy! Let's try that and see how it changes the model.
