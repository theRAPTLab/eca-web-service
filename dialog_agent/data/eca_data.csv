GEMSTEP_Observing,"Type: GEMSTEP_Observing, response: There was only one white flower and it didn't get pollinated",Do you have any guesses about why having just one of that type of flower meant that it didn't get pollinated? Did anybody visit it?
GEMSTEP_Observing,"Type: GEMSTEP_Observing, response: We got a lot of nectar",Great! Sounds like you were able to visit lots of flowers and bring lots of food back to the hive. How did the amount and types of flowers help with that?

GEMSTEP_Observing,"Type: GEMSTEP_Observing, response: The color of the flower matters","In BeeVR, the color of the flower represents different species of flowers, like a flower from a zuccini plant vs. one from a strawberry plant. Why do you think that flower color matters? What does it matter for?"
GEMSTEP_Observing,"Type: GEMSTEP_Observing, response: What happens if the hive gets full?","In nature, if the hive gets full of food, some of the bees might split off and build a new hive. For bees in human-made hives, beekeepers can just take the extra honey out to leave room for new nectar to be collected."
GEMSTEP_Observing,"Type: GEMSTEP_Observing, response: I think distance is important but idk",Let's investigate what the role of distance is! Can you come up with a way to test it using BeeVR?

FoodJustice_MayorEvaluation,"Type: FoodJustice_MayorEvaluation, response: The Mayor should pick the garden because it gives the bees food, it helps us grow food, and it is better for the environment. More gardens means less cars and polluation. It means more flowers for the bees so they can eat nectar and pollen. The plants will grow healthy produce cause they get pollinated so we get healthier food for ourselves too. Its good for the bees, for the people, and for the environment too.","Wow! That is a very convincing argument. You've brought me evidence from many different stakeholders, including people, pollinators, and the health of our overall ecosystem. It sounds like a community garden would be a great choice for our neighborhood."
FoodJustice_MayorEvaluation,"Type: FoodJustice_MayorEvaluation, response: We need a community garden because it gives people in the neighborhood more fresh food that they can grow themselves. Food we grow ourselves is healthier, and it also helps the bees get nectar because they can visit the flowers and pollinated them. This means healthy bees and more food justice for the neighborhood because everyone can get fresh food when they need it.","Wow! That is a very convincing argument. You've brought me evidence from many different stakeholders, including people, pollinators, and the health of our overall ecosystem. It sounds like a community garden would be a great choice for our neighborhood."
FoodJustice_MayorEvaluation,"Type: FoodJustice_MayorEvaluation, response: Gardens are amazing because they are good for the ecosystem. Plants get pollinated by bees, and they need bees in order to grow healthy and colorful fruit. Bees need the plants so they can get lots of nectar to eat. And people need the garden so they can get fresh food and don't need to drive all the way to the grocery store, because they might not have a car.","Wow! That is a very convincing argument. You've brought me evidence from many different stakeholders, including people, pollinators, and the health of our overall ecosystem. It sounds like a community garden would be a great choice for our neighborhood."
FoodJustice_MayorEvaluation,"Type: FoodJustice_MayorEvaluation, response: Bees need gardens for food, and people need gardens for food too. A garden is better for the air than a parking lot because there's less cars. And if we have more bees, the plants in the garden get pollinated and grow better food.","I see! Those are all very important pieces of evidence to consider! It sounds like the garden will help the neighborhood in several different ways. I need to keep thinking, but this was a convincing proposal. Thank you for sharing it!"
FoodJustice_MayorEvaluation,"Type: FoodJustice_MayorEvaluation, response: Parking lots are bad for the environment. But gardens are healthy and give us fresh food. Bees need plants to get food, and they can help us grow better food for us too. We need pollinators to visit our flowers so we can grow the best fruits and veggies.","I see! Those are all very important pieces of evidence to consider! It sounds like the garden will help the neighborhood in several different ways. I need to keep thinking, but this was a convincing proposal. Thank you for sharing it!"
FoodJustice_MayorEvaluation,"Type: FoodJustice_MayorEvaluation, response: We want to help the bees by giving them more flowers, so they have lots of nectar and honey. And when bees go to flowers, they pollinate them. Pollination helps us grow fruits and vegetables. So the garden helps the bees and the people. It helps the environment too by giving us cleaner air.","I see! Those are all very important pieces of evidence to consider!
